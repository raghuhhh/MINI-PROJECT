# MINI-PROJECT
Agricultural Crop Recommendations based on Productivity and Season
In this Project, significance of management of crops was studied vastly. Farmers need assistance with recent technology to grow their crops. Proper prediction of crops can be informed to agriculturists in time basis. Many Machine Learning techniques have been used to analyze the agriculture parameters. Some of the techniques in different aspects o f agriculture are studied by a literature study. Blooming Neural networks, Soft computing techniques plays significant part in providing recommendations. Considering the parameter like production and season, more personalized and relevant recommendations can be given to farmers which makes them to yield good volume of production.
